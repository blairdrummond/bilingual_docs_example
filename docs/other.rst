What is this about?
-------------------

The `Government of Canada Digital Standards <https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/government-canada-digital-standards.html>`_
guide how we are expected to produce our work. Among others, here are some relevant points:

Design with users
'''''''''''''''''

Research with users to understand their needs and the problems we want to solve. Conduct ongoing testing with users to guide design and development.

Iterate and improve frequently
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Develop services using agile, iterative and user-centred methods. Continuously improve in response to user needs. Try new things, start small and scale up.

Build in accessibility from the start
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Services should meet or exceed accessibility standards. Users with distinct needs should be engaged from the outset to ensure what is delivered will work for everyone.

Why documentation matters
-------------------------

Building user-centred and accessible products isn't only about the product, but about the 
documentation for that product as well. At some point the user will have questions, and they 
need the documentation to be able to answer those questions.

`GC AI guiding principles <https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-government-innovations/responsible-use-ai.html#toc1>`_

To ensure the effective and ethical use of AI the government will:

1. understand and measure the impact of using AI by developing and sharing tools and approaches
2. be transparent about how and when we are using AI, starting with a clear user need and public benefit
3. provide meaningful explanations about AI decision making, while also offering opportunities to review results and challenge these decisions
4. be as open as we can by sharing source code, training data, and other relevant information, all while protecting personal information, system integration, and national security and defence
5. provide sufficient training so that government employees developing and using AI solutions have the responsible design, function, and implementation skills needed to make AI-based public services better

Writing an API? `Documenting your API <https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/modern-emerging-technologies/government-canada-standards-apis.html>`_
is still important, but avoid creating *heavy* documentation.


I use these arguments, even though I just made them up...
