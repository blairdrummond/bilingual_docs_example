NDVI Calculator project documentation
=============================================

A look at producing project documentation in multiple languages by leveraging Sphinx.

NDVI Calculator is a fake project, but demonstrates building documentation from code. The python module calculates a 
Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for a small area in Saskatchewan.

.. note::
   This page needs some work

Rather than just translating a some paragraphs this documentation will also show 
how different types of input that can be entered and how those affect the translation 
generator.

   Frontier Counts documentation might be a good spot to use as reference.
   Speak to Collin and Blair, as well as potentially Ekram and Yamina, along with Jean.
