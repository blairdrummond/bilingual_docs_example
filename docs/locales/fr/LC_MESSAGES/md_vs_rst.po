"Markdown is commonly used for writing documentation and other elements in"
" a project. While it is possible to continue using Markdown in Sphinx, it"
" is not recommended for a few different reasons."

"Markdown was originally `created by John Gruber "
"<https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/>`_ for use in blog "
"engines. It was only intended to produce HTML output using text normally "
"found in a blog article. It covers a fair amount of normal text use "
"cases, but purposely excludes some of the more difficult elements such as"
" tables and figures. Support for extensions are also missing, which means"
" your documents have very little semantic meaning. This replicates the "
"problem commonly found with PDF parsing."

"Due to the lack of a formal standard, Markdown has several different "
"*flavours* that are not consistent across implementations. For example, "
"GitLab uses one flabour, but GitHub uses another. These are mostly "
"consistent for normal cases, but are not guaranteed to be. Other flavours"
" exist as well, such as the one implemented by ``pandoc``."

msgid "reStructuredText as a solution"
msgstr ""

#: ../../md_vs_rst.rst:25
msgid ""
"reStructuredText was invented for the purpose of writing technical "
"documentation, and thus addresses the problems with Markdown through "
"different features of the specification. For most normal writing, the "
"overlap between the two makes producing ``.rst`` documents trivial if you"
" are used to Markdown."

"This may not be true for all flavours of Markdown. `Refer to this gist "
"<https://gist.github.com/dupuy/1855764>`_ to see overlap and some "
"differences."

msgid ""
"When starting a new Sphinx project you should produce ``.rst`` documents,"
" but if you already have ``.md`` documents there is no reason to re-write"
" them. Sphinx can use ``recommonmark`` to include markdown documents as "
"source files."
